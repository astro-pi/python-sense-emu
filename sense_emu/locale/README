To construct new translations, just use the standard gettext tools to create
new .po files in this directory. For example, to create a translation for
French:

  $ msginit -lfr_FR

Fill out the .po file accordingly, then the Makefile will take care of
construction of the .mo files during the package build. 

To update the .pot template when source has changed, use the main Makefile in
the project root:

  $ make sense_emu/locales/sense-emu.pot

To update an existing translation with updates from the .pot file, again, use
the main Makefile:

  $ make sense_emu/locales/en_US.po

To force updating everything (the .pot template, all .po files, and
construction of .mo files for testing), use "i18n" target of the main Makefile:

  $ make i18n

Note that .mo files shouldn't be stored in the repo (the .gitignore already
excludes them), and likewise the .pot and .po files won't be included in
package builds, just the .mo outputs (see MANIFEST.in for details).
